Approach 1: Defines a function doubleL that creates a list of doubled numbers up to n. It then iterates through this list and prints each element.

Approach 2: Uses a list comprehension to create a list of doubled numbers up to 5 and then iterates through this list, printing each element.

Approach 3: Defines a generator function doubleG that yields doubled numbers up to n. It then iterates through the generator and prints each element. The advantage of using a generator is that it is more memory-efficient as it produces values on-the-fly rather than storing them in a list.
